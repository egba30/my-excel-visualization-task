# my-excel-visualization-task
On this visualization task, I used Microsoft excel tools like pivot table and vlookup to solve queries like sales by revenue, revenue by region, revenue by products, sales by region, yearly change in revenue, sales trend reprt, revenue by sales rep and others. I made sure the visualization is easy to interpret by a non-professional without getting confused, I made it less colourful but yet pleasing to the eyes for best understanding possible.
